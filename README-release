Here are most of the steps we (maintainers) follow when making a release.

* start from a clean, up-to-date git directory.

    git checkout master; git pull

* Update gnulib to the current version

    git submodule foreach git pull origin master

  Note that the first time you clone the repo you will need to initialize
  the submodule with:

    git submodule update --init ./gnulib/

* Copy the new bootstrap from gnulib:

    cp gnulib/build-aux/bootstrap .

  And then commit the change.

* Adjust shared-library settings, CURRENT:REVISION:AGE in both files,
  libparted/{fs/,}Makefile.am
  following the instructions in the comments there and commit any changes.

* Ensure that the desired versions of autoconf, automake, etc.
  are in your PATH.  See the buildreq list in bootstrap.conf for
  the complete list. Depending on the distribution you are using the
  package names below may be slightly different:

  Fedora Packages
   - libtool
   - autoconf
   - automake
   - bc
   - gperf
   - gcc
   - make
   - texinfo-tex
   - po4a
   - e2fsprogs-devel
   - libuuid-devel
   - libblkid-devel
   - device-mapper-devel
   - ncurses-devel
   - readline-devel
   - check
   - pkgconfig
   - dosfstools
   - sudo
   - perl-Digest-CRC
   - xfsprogs
   - hfsplus-tools
   - btrfs-progs
   - ntfsprogs

  Debian Packages
   - libtool
   - gcc
   - make
   - texinfo
   - texlive
   - po4a
   - uuid-dev
   - libdevmapper-dev
   - ncurses-dev
   - libreadline-dev
   - check
   - pkg-config
   - dosfstools
   - sudo
   - libdigest-crc-perl
   - xfsprogs
   - hfsprogs
   - btrfs-progs
   - ntfs-3g

* Ensure that you're on "master" with no uncommitted diffs.
  This should produce no output: git checkout master; git diff

* Run git clean -xdf first, or make maintainer-clean

* Run bootstrap. This downloads any new translations and creates ./configure

    ./bootstrap

* Run ./configure
  Note that currently -Werror is not included, warnings are intended to be
  fixed, but should not block building unless they are in a new commit.

* If the copyright has not been updated this year, run:

  make update-copyright

  and then commit the changes.

* Pre-release testing:
  Run "make check syntax-check"

  syntax-check may complain about various things. Fix them and commit them.

* Run "make distcheck"

* Set the date, version number, and release type [stable/alpha/beta] on
  line 3 of NEWS, commit that, and tag the release by running e.g.,

    build-aux/do-release-commit-and-tag X.Y stable

* Run the following to create release tarballs.  Your choice selects the
  corresponding upload-to destination in the emitted gnupload command.
  The different destinations are specified in cfg.mk.  See the definitions
  of gnu_ftp_host-{alpha,beta,stable}.

    # "TYPE" must be stable, beta or alpha
    make TYPE

* Test the tarball.  copy it to a few odd-ball systems and ensure that
  it builds and passes all tests.

* While that's happening, write the release announcement that you will
  soon post.

Once all the builds and tests have passed,

* If this is your first time creating a release you will need to have your gpg
  key added to the ftp system. Read this page

  https://www.gnu.org/prep/maintain/html_node/Automated-Upload-Registration.html

  for the details of how to request this.

* Run the gnupload command that was suggested by your "make stable" run above.

  If you are using a different gpg key to sign the releases you will need to
  pass --user <EMAIL> to gnupload to select it.

* Wait a few minutes (maybe up to 30?) and then use the release URLs to
  download all tarball/signature pairs and use gpg --verify to ensure
  that they're all valid.

* Push the NEWS-updating changes and the new tag:

    v=$(cat .prev-version)
    git push origin master tag v$v

* Announce it on Savannah first, so you can include the preferable
  savannah.org announcement link in the email message.

  From here:
    https://savannah.gnu.org/projects/parted/
  click on the "submit news", then write something like the following:
  (If there is no such button, then enable "News" for the project via
   the Main -> "Select Features" menu item, or via this link:
   https://savannah.gnu.org/project/admin/editgroupfeatures.php?group=parted)

    Subject: parted-X.Y released [stable]
    +verbatim+
    ...paste the announcement here...
    -verbatim-

  Then go here to approve it:
    https://savannah.gnu.org/news/approve.php?group=parted

* Send the announcement email message.

* After each non-alpha release, update the on-line manual accessible via

    http://www.gnu.org/software/parted/manual/

  by running this:

    build-aux/gnu-web-doc-update
